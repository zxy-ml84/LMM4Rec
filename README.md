## Environment
The codes of LMM4Rec are implemented and tested under the following development environment:
* numba==0.53.1
* numpy==1.20.3
* scipy==1.6.2
* torch==1.10.3
* torch_scatter==2.0.6

## Update:
We intend to submit this version to the recommendation library shortly.


## Usage
* Configure the xx.conf file in the directory named conf. (xx is the name of the model you want to run)</li>
* Run main.py and choose the model you want to run.</li>
